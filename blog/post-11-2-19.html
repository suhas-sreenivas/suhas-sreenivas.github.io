                <p>
                    I wanted to create a website for myself and when I worked on webapps it was mostly backend; not because of a lack of choice -
                    My frontend skills were poor and I was drawn to the working with django, databases and all that. So I had put off learning it
                    till it was too late - now. I was in a dilemma on how to create my site- should I use a static site generator and call it day 
                    or go back to basics. Which framework should I use? Should I brush up on JS basics before that? I didn't just want to learn
                    syntax. In my seach I found Internetting is Hard. It taught me principles of front end - the importance of seperating the semantics
                    from presentation, best practices(and why) with some history sprinkled in. For some context, the last time I had properly created a
                    website was in 9th grade using frames and so I really didn't understand why using &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; was psuedo-obsolete.
                    I hadn't brushed up on JS or any frameworks and I decided to create my website right away using what I learnt from the tutorial - 
                    and I was able to build this almost exclusively using the tutorial. Just plain HTML and CSS.
